# PROJECT INITIATED !

### Well well well, I tried my best but I guess my skills are still too limited, and I need to learn more. This project has been quite complicated to me, as I felt overwhelemed by the tasks that had to be done... but I'm not giving up, I'll learn from it !

## To execute it :
- npm install
- npm run build
- run a live server on the index.html
- I guess this should be all !
